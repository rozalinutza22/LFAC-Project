I made this project for the Formal Languages, Automata and Compilers class. This project represents a compiler which is designed to recognize basic keywords, control statements, data types and so on. Also, in the t.l file I wrote the keywords and 
the form for each data type. In the t.y file I wrote what my language should recognize and what actions should take.
